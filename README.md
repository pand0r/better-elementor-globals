# Better Elementor Globals for Elementor

This plugin changes the class names of the custom global colors and custom global typographies to a more readable form that is more reusable in CSS.

## Description

This plugin changes the variables names of the custom global colors and custom global typographies to a more readable form that is more reusable in CSS.

For example, if you have a custom global color called "Testimonial Container" it changes the variable name from, for example, '--e-global-color-ab1337' to '--e-global-color-testimonial_container'.

The same applies to global custom typographies. For example, '--e-global-typography-df1337-font-size' becomes '--e-global-typography-eye_catcher-font-size' if the typography is named 'Eye Catcher'.'--e-global-color-ad9560e' in '--e-global-color-testimonial-container'.
